* Recordings
1. No websites in bibs. Leave them in footnotes.
2. OK Errornous citing format (no 2 bracketed numbers in a row)
3. "Traditional method" instead of "Non-DL method"
4. Rethink the words according the "Speech Sanitizer" paper
5. The methodology is still too "experiment-ish"
  - Don't divide it by models, divide it by workflow steps instead. --- Look closely at "subvert" paper
  - Models (workflow?) should have clear structural maps.
  - In more detail describe the "academic" stuffs (func. def, dist.s etc).
  - project-wide definitions
6. The problem statement and the methodology is still too vague.
7. No "Adversary Model" section in problem statement.
8. The Assumption section should be before Scenario
9. More in-depth descriptions of abbrivations (like ABX or so), RIGHT AFTER the first time mentioning it.
10. Rewrite the titles of figures (more detail, and even greater detail in text). Remember to mention the verdict (briefly).
11. Mimic "subvert" paper with the structure of Introduction section. Focus on describing our problem
  - There should be a "Motivation" discuss somewhere in the Introduction.
  - The closing of the Introduction should include navigation details.
12. Main mimicking targets (Towards Private Publish, Sanitizer, Subverting).
13. Still, mention StarGAN in Methodology instead of 

* Thoughts
1. Is our attacking method defensiable under these methods (Our defensive cites)?
  - Talk about if our attack is valid under these defenses? (See cite 9, 11.)

* Editing Points
1. Introduction
2. Methodology

* Next Steps
